# webpack-5-start

Webpack is a bundler for modules. The main purpose is to bundle JavaScript files for usage in a browser, yet it is also capable of transforming, bundling, or packaging just about any resource or asset.

Available Scripts
In the project directory, you can run:

npm install
Install with npm

npm run dev
Runs the app in the development mode.
Open http://localhost:3000 to view it in your browser.

npm run build
Builds the app for production to the dist folder.
It correctly bundles in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.
Your app is ready to be deployed!
